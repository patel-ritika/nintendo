        <p>
        Nintendo's mission is to put smiles on the faces of everyone we touch. We do so by creating new<br/>
         surprises for people across the world to enjoy together. We've forged our own path since 1889,<br/>
          when we began making hanafuda playing cards in Kyoto, Japan. Today, weâ€™re fortunate to be able to<br/>
           share our characters, ideas and worlds through the medium of video games and the entertainment<br/>
            industry.
